### Proposal: 

This project examines user input on restaurants to determine their next restaurant destination. The features examined are:  

    - The restaurant's cuisine  
    - An image from the restaurant's YELP page  
    - The restaurant's price range  
    - The restaurant's rating  
    - Whether the restaurant allows reservations  
    - Whether the restaurant delivers  

The user will then choose whether they would order food from the restaurant displayed and based on 5 - 10 decisions from the user, we will use machine learning to determine the best restaurant for the user.

Our algorithm will be built on previous answers and response, getting more accurate over time.
